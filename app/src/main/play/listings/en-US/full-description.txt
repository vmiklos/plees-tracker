Plees Tracker is a simple sleep tracker for your Android phone.

This is meant to be a very simple open source clone of PrimeNap, i.e. just track sleep start/stop times and count the average / day.

Features:

- It literally does nothing while you sleep, causes no battery drain.

- Stores past sleeps, counts stat from them (average).

- Exports/imports sleep data to/from CSV.

- Can show past sleeps, can selectively edit and delete individual sleeps.

New in 7.2.3:

- Resolves: gh#150 avoid duplicate entries when exportinging to calendar multiple times
