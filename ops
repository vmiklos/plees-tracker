Everything was still greyed out.\nAnd I now just realized why: your app does not have the system permission to access files in memory! In fact, it doesn't even request that permission from the system.\n\nHowever, I was still able to import a file from an external file manager (I'm using Simple File Manager), which does have memory access.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a23dbe11585b9b69511f29df422c106599dc6167b2dc00ea9d6e86e8b3388efd"},"timestamp":1580735841,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTQwODk2Mw==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/issues/1#issuecomment-581408963"},"nonce":"coQ77o3JpMZtvlbtP+3esddmE7g=","message":"Also, would it be possible to have a way to edit each recorded entry? Sometimes I forget to press start before falling asleep, and manually editing unix timestamps is kind of a pain. Maybe tapping/long pressing an entry could open a date and time editor (like google calendar's, for example) and allow the user to change the start and stop time and date.","files":null}]}
