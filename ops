The default is to show the average of daily sums, so you don't hurt your nice average if you stop for an hour, read a book, get sleepy again and then you start tracking.\n\nWith that in mind, does it still make sense to clutter the UI with pause functionality? If so, how would the UI for this look like? Currently you have a single FloatingActionButton to stop tracking, it's not clear to me how we would do a pause.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"471a882371b38fe965ac5b5f66a4a0c62ced8f63a4bd237bb22a92fe2326cd3e"},"timestamp":1685560247,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODbKJfs5nRDndzwAAAAIv8zJE"},"nonce":"UpnkT2YwDqprd6aHskY+ZRa9FIU=","added":["needinfo"],"removed":[]}]}
