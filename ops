I'm just thinking that when the delay timer runs out, it prompts the user \"are you still awake?\" (with a quiet sound to get their attention if they still are, but not looking at the phone), and gives them time to respond.  Your suggestion here of allowing them to select the amount of additional time to give might be a good thing to add to this prompt, but that's up to you.","files":null}]}
