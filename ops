(optional) have many months of sleep data\n2. install/upgrade to `0.7.4` (F-Droid)\n3. (optional) if install was fresh, try add a sleep data point with a date prior to `2022-08-16`\n\n**Actual result**\nAny sleep data before `2022-08-16` does not appear in main screen, nor any stats or graphs.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nSleep data should be present as usual.\n\n**Extra Notes:**\n - I tried restoring an older backup into the app (from an old phone), received an error message `File version could not be synced...` (couldn't catch it all since it only appeared briefly).\n - I updated my old phone with pre-`2022-08-16` data in it and it is empty / shows no data. I then reverted the app version to `0.7.3` and re-imported it's own backup, and the data showed up again.\n - On trying to add an sleep event in the past (pre-`2022-8-16`), the data will not appear, _however_ it seems new sleeps are still tracked with the same `Sleep #nnn` number, while my app only shows 7 data points, the Sleep # is in the hundreds (as it should be).\n - I backed up data again after upgrading to `0.7.4` where the pre-`2022-8-16` data has disappeared, and all the data is still present in the `backup.csv`, so it appears that **no data loss has occurred**, which is good.","files":null}]}
