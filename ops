I guess doing this weekly would make sense, with the ability to set a higher frequency. And probably we can avoid a timer, just do the export in case we just finished sleeping and there is no export yet for the current week.\n\nAre you interested in looking at this yourself? Probably not hyper complex to add, the export code is already there.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"5f62520189493efa8eb074e55b62ab5df3a30e68"},"timestamp":1599980762,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3NjAxNjgyODU="},"added":["confirmed"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"5f62520189493efa8eb074e55b62ab5df3a30e68"},"timestamp":1599980762,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3NjAxNjgyODY="},"added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"5f62520189493efa8eb074e55b62ab5df3a30e68"},"timestamp":1600468010,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTExMzAwMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/issues/32#issuecomment-695113001"},"message":"Do you have any other open source app that has such a feature already? I'm asking as I guess the trick here is to get permanent access to a nextcloud folder. Normally nextcloud is a storage provider, so if I select a folder, I may easily get some URL which is working right after a selection, but not after restarting the app.\n\nSeeing how others do this kind of thing would help avoiding such pitfalls.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4674d2d6b98bce535847dbf2afc4ef3d2dcb55ab"},"timestamp":1600536697,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTMzNTUyOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/issues/32#issuecomment-695335529"},"message":"Sorry, for the late answer! I missed this. I don't believe I would be able to implement anything like this, since I never worked in Java before. :( Sorry. \n\nAnd I actually didn't mean that the app should export directly to NextCloud. :) That I haven't actually seen (except for something that syncs like Joplin Noteapp), but that is a different feature. \n\nThe NextCloud Android app has a feature that you can tell it that anything that is stored inside a certain folder should be synced to the cloud when you have wifi. So basically if the app exports a csv, xml or whatever backup format you use. I can tell the NextCloud app to look in that folder when I'm on Wifi and upload anything inside. :)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"5f62520189493efa8eb074e55b62ab5df3a30e68"},"timestamp":1600543163,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTM0NjczMA==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/issues/32#issuecomment-695346730"},"message":"Ah OK, storing to just a dir on the \"sd card\" is easier, great.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e24c5fd1543c55b64fe39d0ebe170ec3b4026dc9"},"timestamp":1604481142,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTYwOTUxOA==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/issues/32#issuecomment-721609518"},"message":"Yes, we need an auto export option at a particular location","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"8bfe0087ae114abf538a5a3d8f2460c3dd0e9bd2"},"timestamp":1608680209,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE0MjEyMjY5Nw=="},"status":2},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"5f62520189493efa8eb074e55b62ab5df3a30e68"},"timestamp":1608680335,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTgzNzI0MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/issues/32#issuecomment-749837240"},"message":"You can now test this if you build from source.
