But then the question is what to do with the data model, which really just has a start and a stop timestamp for the sleep. If you pause for 1h, then just resume and a final stop would lead to a sleep that has the original start timestamp and the new stop timestamp and the length of the sleep would be incorrect.\n\nIf the use-case is to please the \"average\" graph, then perhaps this could be a new column in the sleeps table, which would be the total length of pauses in the sleep. That would be backwards-compatible, but need to handle that at several places, I guess.\n\nAre you interested in doing a PR for this yourself?","files":null}]}
