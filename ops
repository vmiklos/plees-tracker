It would be good to see what APIs or configs they use to have this. Also to see if they do this by default or if this is opt-in. Keeping the default unchanged always makes me feel safer.\n\nMy first thought is that I'm not particularly interested in this (dark mode in itself is already a bit painful), but if somebody does the work, I don't mind. :-) Thanks.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"471a882371b38fe965ac5b5f66a4a0c62ced8f63a4bd237bb22a92fe2326cd3e"},"timestamp":1713615572,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODbKJfs6GYNGmzwAAAALr5mo8"},"nonce":"u7IiF5nMFpmUNr1fDQX4yTASX14=","added":["needinfo"],"removed":[]}]}
