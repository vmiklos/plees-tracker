The author wishes to be anonymous but they agreed to publish the content in an issue:\n\n\u003e Hello.\n\u003e \n\u003e The app might be too simple.\n\u003e \n\u003e The app shows my recent sleep log with a start time of 2024-12-18 at 05:02 and a wake time of 2024-12-18 at 14:00. That's perfectly legible as 5am to 2pm. No problem there.\n\u003e However, the same times are being shown in the CSV data export spreadsheet as a start time of 1734526967595 and a wake time of 1734559209784.\n\u003e \n\u003e This isn't a readable number. It just doesn't even slightly represent the actual times.\n\u003e \n\u003e Please explain to me exactly how 5:02 am on 12-18-2024 equates to 1734526967595.\n\u003e Please explain that to me in a way that your explanation will also make perfect sense to my neurologist who's a sleep specialist â€” whom, by the way, wants to see my sleep log for evidence of my sleep disorder.\n\u003e \n\u003e When I send her the sleep log CSV export file, she's going to be totally confused with this nonsensical data translation.\n\u003e \n\u003e By the way, the spreadsheet data doesn't even show the total sleep duration per sleep session. That's more important than the star ratings which are shown in the spreadsheet.\n\n**Actual result**\nThe current CSV output is meant to be a backup, i.e. the primary purpose is to be able to re-import it.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThis user probably expects an output that has human-readable start/stop times and also a length.\n\nPossibly the best way would be to add one more setting: if it's on, the export result won't be something we can import back, but at it'll look like a timesheet and it'll be more readable for humans. I guess that's fair enough as a use-case.","files":null}]}
