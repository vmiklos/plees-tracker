So based on this, no need to pause a sleep: if you interrupt your sleep for some reason, just pause it \u0026 start again at a later point.\n\nThe other problem is that this app tries hard not to spy on you. The lack of listening on screen events, microphone, etc is considered a feature.\n\nPerhaps the easiest subset of your request would be some kind of auto-start mode -- so in case the phone is idle for a defined period of time, then tracking starts automatically. I didn't check if Android gives you an event that can be used here -- it's a bit recursive (you want to do something on idle, but if you do it, you won't be idle anymore).\n\nAnyhow, you are interested in contributing such an auto-start mode yourself or at least researching what Android APIs could be used here?
