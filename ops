This could be 0 stars by default, and then you can set it to something useful by tapping on the stars.\n\nThis also means I need to extend the DB schema to store the rating, but it seems that's not too complex:\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/migrating-db-versions\n\nThis has the benefit that there is no annoying / interrupting popup and I don't have to add more settings, either.","files":null}]}
