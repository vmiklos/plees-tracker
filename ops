Happy to have find it on F-Droid !!\n\nSuggestion :\nIn the main screen, when swiping right or left on a night/sleep, the swiped item is deleted.\nA user validation would be fine, or at least showing the fact that it will be deleted by showing a trashbin on the left when swiping right (resp. on the right when swiping left).\n\nThanks\nGLLM","files":null}]}
