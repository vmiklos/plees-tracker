It has everything I need regarding features to track my sleep. The only thing I would like to ask if it would be possible to set an automatic export of data once every day or week? \n\nThe reason for this is that I could then tell my NextCloud app to always upload all data from the backup folder when I'm on WIFI. This way if I lose my phone (and haven't manually exported the data in a while) I would still have an automatic backup.","files":null}]}
