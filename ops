I just tested this manually, master works here just fine. Though I'm on Android 10. I also wrote an androidTest for this back then (see testImportExport() in app/src/androidTest/java/hu/vmiklos/plees_tracker/MainActivityInstrumentedTest.kt), and Travis intentionally runs on Android 5.1 (API level 22).\n\nAnyhow, perhaps the test is poor and there is still to be fixed here. :-) PRs are welcome, as long as the already working cases keep working.","files":null}]}
