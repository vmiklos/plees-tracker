I imagine a setting where I can simply create multiple time based, recurring reminders that will trigger a notification. Optimally tracking would be started or stopped respectively when the notification (or a button on it) is pressed.\n\nAdditionally such reminders could even serve as a call to go to bed.","files":null}]}
