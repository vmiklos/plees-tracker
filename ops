If this is a limitation, setting stars on that view probably won't be feasible.\n\nFrom a UX standpoint, preventing a reintroduction of #161 seems feasible via two mechanisms:\n\n- make setting the star rating require a long-press (unsure if scrolling, the finger remains on the UI element but it moves counts as long press - intuitively I'd say no, but needs to be verified. Only after long-pressing initiate the UI to set / change star rating by switching the long-press into swipe gesture)\nor\n- when tapping the stars show an overlay that requires additional interaction to set the star rating (this could work in a way, that if no further interaction is done, e.g. when intending to scroll, the overlay automatically closes once the user lifts their finger. Setting a star rating could require an additional lift of the finger and additional tap on the star rating in the overlay)\n\nWondering how other Android apps handle star ratings. I had a glance at my installed apps but none used star ratings. Probalby the commercial sleep trackers do. But then again those are not open source so can't be inspected easily as to how their implementation works.","files":null}]}
