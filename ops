Also, the signatures are not guaranteed to stay stable across releases, I had to change it once -- perhaps you hit that problem. Anyhow, one idea is to:\n\n1) export your current sleeps to CSV\n2) double-check that the CSV has plausible amount of rows, i.e. it \"has your data\"\n3) uninstall the old version\n4) install the new version\n5) import your old CSV back\n\nThen you can go to settings, enable this \"pretty export\" mode and export again, this time producing the human-readable timestamps and durations you asked for.","files":null}]}
