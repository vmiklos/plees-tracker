It seemed so far that one of \"average of (sum of sleeps during a day)\" and \"average(individual sleeps)\" is the most most useful one, that's why the dashboard features them.\n\nI personally care about the first, but I understand that in case you sleep more than once a day, then that one is not useful; in this case hopefully the second is useful.\n\nWhat is exactly the suggestion, would you like to only show one of these, and add an option to decide which one? Or add one more graph?\n\nI don't mind more graphs if you're interested in contributing the code for that yourself.\n\nThanks for the brainstorming. :-)","files":null}]}
