It does not work reliably for me now. Most of the times it just brings up plees activity to the foreground but does not toggle actual tracking state. It seems this button works reliably before plees tracker is started but if is already running then toggle does not happen.\n\nAlso a couple of days ago I have unlocked my phone with fingerprint and the first thing I saw was plees tracker activity. Tracking stopped and at the sleep end time current second is shown. I had not interacted with my phone in any way besides of scanning fingertip. Why did is stop? It happens rather frequently, so when I absent mindedly tap button attempting to stop tracking (that is already stopped) I start another one instead.","files":null}]}
