In fact, it doesn't even request that permission from the system.\n\nOh, this is interesting. Do you rename the file between the export and import? You're right, reading https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/blob/862fdd74e542a62035fa5920bdb82baf5a8c598e/app/src/main/java/hu/vmiklos/plees_tracker/DataModel.kt#L92 shows that export calls takePersistableUriPermission(), while import does not. I always tested import with a file that was previously exported. ;-)\n\n\u003e Also, would it be possible to have a way to edit each recorded entry?\n\nSure, why not.
