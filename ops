But the mean value of sleeps does not represent these differences. Therefore I would suggest adding standard deviation or variation into the mix. I suggest updating the design like this, maybe using % instead of the time as time diff can confuse somebody. Also this is only useful for daily average, not sleep average as a small nap would make this totally irrelevant.\nThanks for the app!\n\n![Screenshot_20230527-093451_Plees Tracker.png](https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/assets/47794319/b5f68e0f-e48b-4498-b44e-5618cd005310)","files":null}]}
