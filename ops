The release page has an automatically produced .apk, which is not suitable for the average user, since it's not signed. I'm not sure how to make them signed -- if I sign it with a throw-away key, then the next release can't be installed, because it'll be a different key.\n\nF-Droid is exactly supposed to solve this problem for most users.\n\nSo I guess the short answer is that either you get it from F-Droid, build it from source (this is what I personally do) or you figure out how to lower your Android security settings (if possible at all) to allow installing an un-signed .apk.\n\nGoogling for \"android install unsigned apk\" probably gives you some hints.
