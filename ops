Is it possible that google calendar only gives events which are cached locally and if you have a longer period with sleeps, then plees tracker has those sleeps, but google calendar does not?\n\nIf so, we would need to know where to cut off our own sleep list (so only export the sleeps where the target calendar has events). I'm not sure how to get that info from the calendar.\n\nMaybe you know any other open-source app that exports to the calendar? I imagine e.g. a running tracker app would have the same trouble.
