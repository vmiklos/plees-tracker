Would a second button next to Start be against design guidelines ?\n\nI've seen other apps have multiple buttons in the lower right corner but IIRC it is usually subordinated to a main action, i.e. secondary functions are accessed in some way, after activating the only button being displayed.\n\nHopefully this is clear enough; should you need an example, in AntennaPod activate Multi Select, this will show a button similar to the Start button in plees, which, when pressed, brings up multiple subordinate options.\n\nIf the second button is a no-no, then perhaps use tap'n'hold ? However, you would need a cue to inform the user that the button has a secondary function.","files":null}]}
