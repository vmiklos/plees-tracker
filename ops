Do you actually use this feature that the app would have a custom \"is dark\" setting, not following the system theme? My understanding is that this option was primarily added when lots of phones didn't run new enough Android to have a \"system dark mode\" setting. But possibly these days ~everyone is on new enough Android, and then all these settings can be removed and we can just always use the system dark mode setting.","files":null}]}
