As you know, that means ~20% of Android devices (which is tens of millions of devices) cannot use the current version of this app.\n\nPersonally, I repurpose an old Android device as my \"sleep device\".\n\nWhat would be lost by changing the minimum required API to a level that would allow this helpful app to work with at least 95% of Android devices that are in use?  If 95% isn't a reasonable goal, what about ~90%?","files":null}]}
