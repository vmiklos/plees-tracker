The rating feature was added in #28, @Narcolapser any opinion on the above? I.e. the request is to make the main activity rating widgets read-only, and only rate in the sleep activity. I'm a bit unsure, the current UI makes it easy to rate, which would be more complicated. On the other hand, it's currently confusing that a swipe results in a rate or on a sleep delete, depending on where you swipe, which is not ideal.\n\nI confirm, it happened to me this morning. I was swiping in my sleep items, and inadvertently put my finger on a star strip as I had to scroll quite a bit and boom : I changed a sleep item's rating.\nI really think the rating should be readonly on the main screen ;)","files":null}]}
