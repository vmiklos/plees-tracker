And yes, swiping can delete it.\n\nE.g. the gmail app does the same swiping to delete emails, there is even a hint that it'll delete the sleep, a red background + trash icon is shown as the swipe is started. Same is there in nextcloud notes, so it feels like this is pretty standard.\n\nBut still, are you aware of an app that has a better hint, we can consider following that as an example?","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"471a882371b38fe965ac5b5f66a4a0c62ced8f63a4bd237bb22a92fe2326cd3e"},"timestamp":1666679757,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODbKJfs5UqVc6zwAAAAHIl9w-"},"nonce":"XNedmTQSmntEL8UxElNnUkUoaxo=","added":["needinfo"],"removed":[]}]}
