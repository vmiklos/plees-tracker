Especially since on my phone the messages \"started on\"/\"ended on\" and the date are overlapping.\n\nMy idea is that some buttons that do edit and delete could be added to the activity that show every sleep. Or, for the dates, a edit button.\n\nOr you could put a little description (like \"swipe to delete\") the first time a sleep shows up, and the same with the instructions for the first time a sleep is opened in a separate screen.\n\nOr rather, a button in the menu liking to the documentation/how to :)","files":null}]}
