I can't think of any proper test in this situation.\n`plees-tracker` isn't where there are problems with the mime type handling, it is just the android file picker who does not accept selecting the proper file because it represents the mimeType differently.\n\nI suggest to merge my commit, or decide that all plain text files are acceptable for the parser and just change the `intent.type` to `text/*`.","files":null}]}
