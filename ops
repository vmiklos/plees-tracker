To be able to swipe the card views (\"sleeps\") in the recyclerview (\"sleep list\"), we install a swipe listener with the above mentioned `attachToRecyclerView()` call. Once this is done, all swipe gestures are intercepted by this swipe listener, and it's not easy to whitelist just the rating bar.\n\nI have some PoC code to detect if the touch event is inside the rating bar or not, but it's dirty and I still could not find a way to redirect the touch event to the rating bar in that case.
