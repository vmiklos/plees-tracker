If you start tracking and you don't stop in 8 hours (by default), then it makes sense to trigger a notification.\n\nI assume the way to do that is something like https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/alarms/schedule\n\nThat is just for the stop part, and perhaps it needs a setting to be opt-in, but otherwise it would solve half of what this issue is requesting.","files":null}]}
