Editing works, but I wouldn't mind an option to do it directly. Maybe you could default the end time to $now and start time to ${now minus sleep goal time}? So you don't through the hassle of changing the date (assuming you go to sleep from one day to another). Thanks for your work, either way!","files":null}]}
