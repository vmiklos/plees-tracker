One at night that says something like \"Almost bedtime. Try reading or meditating\". It automatically estimates when you went to bed and woke up (based on phone usage or the gyro sensor, I assume). It then sends a notification in the morning asking if the estimated time is correct and if so, to record it. \n\nI don't think this app needs the auto-estimate feature but these types of notifications would be nice. Samsung Health requires an account to use it, so let me know if you want me to take screenshots of the notifications and app UI. \n\nWould like to help someday but I'm currently caught up with college and work.","files":null}]}
