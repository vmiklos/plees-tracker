I find light mode easier to look at in the dark than dark mode. I am sure this is because in dark mode the solid white text and especially \"Sleeps\" and \"Daily\" are too bright against the solid black (#000000) background.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3495ce8e-5a74-4222-a504-b783aad59e36\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Light-mode screenshot.\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3495ce8e-5a74-4222-a504-b783aad59e36\" height=\"300\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32474997-e722-42c3-a6cc-a40829309854\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Dark-mode screenshot.\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32474997-e722-42c3-a6cc-a40829309854\" height=\"300\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIt would be nice if the user interface had lower contrast in dark mode. For comparison, here is a \"before\" and \"after\" mockup made by Claude and slightly edited to change the colors. I don't mean that you should use these exact colors; this is just to illustrate the idea.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f276e88e-395b-46d4-98b8-d4b57cb8faf1\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"A mockup with the original colors.\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f276e88e-395b-46d4-98b8-d4b57cb8faf1\" height=\"300\"\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c12abcd-c2d8-448d-a727-49d69ee7fc20\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"A mockup with updated colors.\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c12abcd-c2d8-448d-a727-49d69ee7fc20\" height=\"300\"\u003e","files":null}]}
