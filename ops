Now I have one sleep logged of 0 minutes, and the average sleep times calculated is off because of it.\nCould you add the possibility to remove one sleep? It seems to me that now I can only delete everything, which I don't want to.\n\nThanks for the app anyway :) it looks quite good","files":null}]}
