I wonder if maybe exporting the sleep id to the event description would be an approach worth looking into or if the sleep id can be persisted to the event in another way. As far as I know, there's no mechanism for storing the id in the data structure of a calendar other than through fields the user could later change, so there's potentially no 'foolproof' solution to this.\n\nThinking slightly outside the box here; Maybe after the user's first successful export, when any subsequent export is requested, the user is presented with a dialog to allow them to export all sleeps SINCE their previous export or ALL sleeps.\nThen the only thing that needs tracking is the time of the last sleep per export and no duplicate events are made.","files":null}]}
