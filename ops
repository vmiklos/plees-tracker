The music player case seems to be a special case and we should not pretend to be a music player. :-)\n\nBut we already provide a quick settings tile that is accessible without unlock, the trouble is that as soon as you tap on it, you still need to unlock. Perhaps that's something to be investigated -- maybe we just need to opt in somewhere to allow start/stop of sleep without unlock. That would be fine, as long as this would be user-configurable. Like, I don't want my kids to be able to change my sleep db, but your use-case would be improved with such a mode.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for brainstorming!","files":null}]}
