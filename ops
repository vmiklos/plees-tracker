Allow the user to add a sleep block manually without all the wiggling about described above.\n2. Don't ask the user to enter the date twice. If you know what time and date the user woke up then you can infer the start date of the sleep block. For instance, if I pick 22:00 as a start and then 9:00 as wake-up, you can pretty much be sure that the start date must be the day before. If I picked 3:00, assuming the same finish time, then it must be the same date.","files":null}]}
