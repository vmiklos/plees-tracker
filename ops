The app already has pretty impressive graphs and additionally, I was thinking to have one feature that will be helpful. \n\nDay wise trends, I mean day vs number of hours on X and Y axis respectively. This way, I can look for trends and understand if on certain days my sleep schedule is being altered. For example, maybe Friday nights I might tend to sleep late or Wednesday nights somehow due to my work schedule it tends to be delayed,  or Sunday night my sleep decreases due to late night and early Monday etc.\n\nIt's not critical, but it definitely helps to have this in the long run when I see it 6 months down the line, it could give me some interesting insights using which I could be more conscious and alter my schedule accordingly to make it productive.","files":null}]}
