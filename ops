A few nights were already tracked on the device the import is attempted on, but those never vanish nor is older data added.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe import should ideally add data to the existing data or if that is not possible remove the current data and replace it with the imported data. In the latter case a warning dialog should ask users how to proceed.\n\nAndroid 13.1\nPlees Tracker 7.6.0 (46)","files":null}]}
