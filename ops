Should we just not update the timestamp or rather reset to 0 when a negative duration is requested?\n\nWhat about moving the other time? If the starting time is set to a time after the ending time, the ending time could be updates to match (duration of zero) and vice versa.\n\nIf it is possible to put input limits on the picker, that would also work, but it might get in the way of the user experience.\n\nSome descriptive error could be best, too.","files":null}]}
