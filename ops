Or you just hide the seconds for start/stop but still show it for the duration, which is a bit inconsistent.\n\n\u003e Also wondering why the time zone is shown.\n\nThis is helpful in countries that do daylight saving time changes. E.g. here sleeping from 2am to 3am usually means 1 hour duration, but sometimes it's 0 or 2. Without timezones, this just looks buggy.\n\nBut sure, adding a \"compact time view\" (or similarly named) option is fine. Are you interested in sending a PR for this yourself?","files":null}]}
