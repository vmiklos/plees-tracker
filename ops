(Other people may need 6h, the app doesn't care.)\n\nI assume then what you need is better support for your multiple sleeps / day: what about a new avg that sums up sleeps / day, and then counts the avg of that? Would that be your use-case?\n\n(What counts is \"sleeps\" of the day is a bit unclear, perhaps we could approximate that by grouping the sleeps that ends the same day.)","files":null}]}
