Most users should never set anything there, so it's fine to have a lot of settings there. Once once you enable the setting, it should ask for the alarm permission, etc.\n\nThe other complexity is tests: as you add more and more optional behavior, it becomes more and more hard to test all combinations. If somebody has an idea around the FIXME in\n\nhttps://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/blob/7a2a777a76cf7c52400699e3e9589b70ea3ab561/app/src/androidTest/java/hu/vmiklos/plees_tracker/MainActivityInstrumentedTest.kt#L74-L84\n\nthat would be interesting, since that trouble blocks getting closer to \"every fix comes with a test\", which would be my ideal.","files":null}]}
