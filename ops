The rating feature was added in https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/issues/28, @Narcolapser any opinion on the above? I.e. the request is to make the main activity rating widgets read-only, and only rate in the sleep activity. I'm a bit unsure, the current UI makes it easy to rate, which would be more complicated. On the other hand, it's currently confusing that a swipe results in a rate or on a sleep delete, depending on where you swipe, which is not ideal.","files":null}]}
