(Swiping on the stars works like slider.) It is very natural an intuitive \n\nHowever,in plees-tracker I always swipe whole record and delete it.\n\nLuckily the \"undo\" saved me.\n\n-----\n\nCan this \"slide to rate\" function can be added? Is it easy? \n\nLike this is small UX improvement so if its hard to implement I guess its not worth it, but it - would save me some miss-clicks. :)","files":null}]}
