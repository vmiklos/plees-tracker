Does it happen to you all the time you perform these steps or it happened only once?\n\nAlso, does this only happen with your phone or does it also happen in the emulator?\n\nLast, does this happen even after you restart the app?\n\nThe internal storage is just sqlite and the stats are always calculated from scratch, so if you see your sleeps in the stats, then probably they are in the DB. This would suggest the DB is all fine, but the main activity's live update somehow gets confused and shows no sleeps. Does this still happen after you kill the app + start it again? I.e. is this a problem when you already changed your settings but the already running app tries to adapt itself to the new setting?\n\nLet's try to clarify the reproducer steps to reach a state when this happens in a from-scratch emulator run, then it would be possible to debug this.
