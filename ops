These apps usually have a phony-baloney sleep graph (makes guesses when you might be in deep sleep. As my name suggests, I'm narcoleptic, for medical reasons I know what my sleep cycle looks like) with an option of stars below. The idea with those is a kind of review of your slumber before you give a manual input for a review. \n\nDrawing from that, to provide user context I think the snapshot review is a good idea. I'm not sure how Kotlin works but if you could just take that same display card that is used to display \"past sleeps\" and display that, it would give me a moment to think \"yea, that sleep and wake time looks right\" see how much I slept and then punch one of the 5 stars below. The confirm behavior would be a good question. It seems silly to have to click a star and then click ok, but I think since your finger covers the stars when you press it could lead to problems of fat fingering and cause frustration, while a confirm button would feel pretty normal.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"5f62520189493efa8eb074e55b62ab5df3a30e68"},"timestamp":1596035624,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NTcyNTA4MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker/issues/28#issuecomment-665725081"},"message":"I did a bit of research: so the android UI has a rating bar for this:\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RatingBar\n\nit would be possible to show the rating below the \"slept for\" row for each sleep.
