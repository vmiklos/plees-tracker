So makes sense to keep the setting, but simplify it to a 3-way dropdown instead of the current toggle of pairs. The code for the preferences activity is here:\n\n- activity kotlin code: app/src/main/java/hu/vmiklos/plees_tracker/PreferencesActivity.kt\n- preferences xml: app/src/main/res/xml/preferences.xml\n- mapping from android preferences to user-visible strings: app/src/main/java/hu/vmiklos/plees_tracker/Preferences.kt\n- commit 53d64216a56e939f307316f433c0813817d0f5aa (bedtime/wakeup: show the value of these in the preferences activity, 2025-05-09) was somewhat similar\n\nProbably makes sense to keep the underlying Android settings unchanged and just tweak the UI here. Are you interesting in looking into this yourself? Hopefully it's reasonably straightforward with the above code pointers. Thanks.","files":null}]}
