Create a new sleep entry, by starting \u0026 stopping the tracker.\n2. Click on the entry to edit it.\n3. Change the starting or the stop time of the entry, by clicking on the starting/stop time and filing out the Date-Time-Picker.\n4. Now, still on the screen with the \"Sleep Details\" you have multiple options to return to the main screen: a) use the on-screen \"back\" button, rendered by the app, b) use the hardware \"back\" button of the phone or c) close the app and open it again.\n\nIf you use 4.a) then the changes to the entry are saved. If you use 4.b) or 4.c) then the changes to the entry are not saved.\n\nIf I recall correctly, it was possible in earlier versions to use 4.b) to save the changes.\nIs this possible again with the patch of #255?\nUntil a new version comes out, I'll use 4.a) as a workaround.","files":null}]}
