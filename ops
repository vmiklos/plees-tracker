I'm happy with it ! :)\n\nMy problem is that, after a few nights, I cannot remember if, when waking up in the morning, I felt fantastic, good, tired or wrecked !\n\nThere are a number of info I'd be willing to add/store with each sleep item:\n- a rating of the night (i.e. wake up feeling with regards to the night) : with stars from 0 to 5 \n- room temperature : a number\n- food quantity : rating from 0 to 5\n- moon phase : well, a moon phase\n\nWhat would be lovely would be to be able to add more info to sleep items, to try detect patterns like : \n- sleep quality vs sleep length\n- sleep quality vs bed time\n- sleep quality vs food quantity\n- sleep quality vs room temperature\n- sleep quality vs moon phases\n- sleep quality vs small awoken periods at night\n\nAs a MVP, simply adding \u0026 storing a sleep rating (from 0 to 5 stars) would be fine, so one is able to look it up afterwards. And make one's own stats/analysis.\n\nAs a V2, showing for each rating :  the average  bedtime, avg sleep length, avg room temp, avg moon phases, avg food quantity (1to5)  would be fantastic.\n\nWhat do you think about this ?\n\nThanks\nGLLM","files":null}]}
