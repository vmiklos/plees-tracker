But this is not what I wanted. And this does not happen every time and only occasionally. i cannot figure out why.\n\nSometimes i wake up brifly during the night and go back to sleep. In the morning I may find that sleep stopped when I woke up. Does it stop when I unlock the phone? Does not seem to happen every time I unlock the phone. And this is again confusing. Sleep logging stop on device unlock is never mentioned, cannot be configured and therefore is mysterious to the user until he guesses.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nSleep logging starts and stops only upon explicit command by a user.","files":null}]}
