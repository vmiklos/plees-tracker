In this case, an average stat that takes these days into account is required.\n\nHowever, this let's me acknowledge 3 valid stats:\n\n- Average sleep duration (current average stat)\n- Average sleep on days with sleep (current daily stat?)\nThis is relevant to answer \"How long are my sleep sessions on average?\" with multiple sleeps a day. It is not entirely accurate but grouping sleeps per day looks like a simple definition for \"sleep session\" that still makes sense.\n- Average sleep duration per day\nThe use case i described in this issue","files":null}]}
