While this made sense initially, I'd personally rather see only stats from just my recent sleeps, eg the past week. Would it be possible to make the Dashboard summary duration customizable, for example to the options provided in the Statistics page (`Last 7 days`, `This year`, `All time`)?\n\n1: If anybody else needs it, here's the quick Python script I wrote to convert Sleep as Android CSV to Plees CSV: https://gist.github.com/usashiki/d6f918b1d3c8035f3da8a9f51962c417","files":null}]}
