So I was unable to achieve my objective: Simple 1-5 rating for sleep.\n\nThe (non-privacy respecting/add riddled) sleep apps I've used in the past usually all have a simple 1-5 (though usually in half or quarter steps) star rating system. I find this momentary reflection on my sleep to be valuable in tracking the over all quality of my sleep. I can't imagine it would be to hard to implement, but the compiler yelled at me when I tried so I'm submitting a feature request instead.","files":null}]}
