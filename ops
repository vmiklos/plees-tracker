Nice app I use everyday to see what time I go to sleep, so the \"start time\" from the graphs. Would it be possible to see the average of start time instead of the average of length of sleep? For now, I go checking the graph \"start time\" to see the average line go up or down, but I thing it would be great to see the average number on the dashboard. The idea would be to choose what data to show on the dashboard (length average, start time average, stop time average, etc.).\n\nThank you for this great app I enjoy. I hope you will understand (and answer to) my request!","files":null}]}
