I'm working though a few hundred notifications.  Such fun!\n\nAPI level 16 or 17 is ideal to work with older devices, but API level 23 will handle the device I currently use to track sleep.\n\nI suppose for regions with DST, you could allow users to manually enter the transition dates if the API doesn't support providing them.\n\nBTW, do you know how Android handles the situation when regulations change DST for specific regions?  For example, let's say a device uses API 28 and no longer gets updates.  Then let's say a user lives in a region that has DST.  Then the regulations change so that DST is removed for the region.  Does the Android device somehow know about this change, or is it forever \"broken\"?","files":null}]}
