No, if I'm waking up in the night for more than a dozen minutes, I'd like to track my waking with the least effort possible. A button accessible from the lock screen (just like music players have a pause button there) would be better than unlocking but would still require to look at the screen in the middle of the night though.\n\nI understand it's not necessarily easy to implement (I'm not an android developer, I wouldn't even know where to start).\n\nConsider this a feature for insomniac people that would like to track their wakes even more importantly than start-end of bedtime. But of course, an app cannot accommodate every single user's specific needs! Especially if the app creator isn't compensated for that developing that app.\n\n\u003e The other problem is that this app tries hard not to spy on you. The lack of listening on screen events, microphone, etc is considered a feature.\n\nBut the app being open-source, there's no trust issue with what the app is doing with the data: we can check it's only kept locally.\n\n\u003e Anyhow, you are interested in contributing such an auto-start mode yourself or at least researching what Android APIs could be used here? Thanks.\n\nI'm not an android developer but it seems this might be of interest: https://stackoverflow.com/a/25153216\n\n```\nIntent.ACTION_SCREEN_ON\nIntent.ACTION_SCREEN_OFF\n```","files":null}]}
