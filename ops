Tracking only starts when you tap on the start button and stops only when you tap on the stop button. Of course, Android may decide to kill the sleep service, which means that the indicator of the tracking is lost, but I fear an app can't do much about that.\n\nAnd yes, if you reboot the phone, then plees-tracker stores the start time in a setting, so can re-start the tracking service, but only if you manually launch the app.\n\nDo you know any other open source app that has a more reliable way to launch a background service with a notification icon? IIRC what plees-tracker currently does is more or less the same as the built-in Android clock app, which is considered reasonably reliable.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"471a882371b38fe965ac5b5f66a4a0c62ced8f63a4bd237bb22a92fe2326cd3e"},"timestamp":1655148963,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODbKJfs5Lm_OMzwAAAAGVPGIf"},"nonce":"u9lWIyZ85QfT8p/x2lIVHcv1CNs=","added":["needinfo"],"removed":[]}]}
