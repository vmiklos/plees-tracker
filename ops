I missed this. I don't believe I would be able to implement anything like this, since I never worked in Java before. :( Sorry. \n\nAnd I actually didn't mean that the app should export directly to NextCloud. :) That I haven't actually seen (except for something that syncs like Joplin Noteapp), but that is a different feature. \n\nThe NextCloud Android app has a feature that you can tell it that anything that is stored inside a certain folder should be synced to the cloud when you have wifi. So basically if the app exports a csv, xml or whatever backup format you use. I can tell the NextCloud app to look in that folder when I'm on Wifi and upload anything inside. :)","files":null}]}
