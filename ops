The daily average is not informative and actually false in its current implementation. I don't track sleep every day. And in my case of the 4 days I tracked last month this comes down to an average lf 1 hour of sleep per day.\n\nWhile this is mathematically correct, it certainly is not helpful to the user.\n\nA better way to handle this is to simply calculate the daily average from the nights where sleep was actually tracked and ignore the days, where no tracking occured for the calculation of daily average.","files":null}]}
