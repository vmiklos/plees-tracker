Make sure the device enables dark theme at night and light theme at day time\n2. In plees tracker settings enable \"Follow System Theme\" \n3. Kill Plees tracker\n4. Wait till device theme changes to dark\n5. Start Plees tracking. I have tried only starting from notification drawer widget but probably any way will do\n6. Don't touch the device anymore. Let it lock screen after timeout\n7. Wait until system switches to light theme\n8. Unlock the device. Observe Plees in dark theme for a fraction of second\n9. Plees tracker restarts to switch to light theme and stops tracking\n\nI am not sure as this sequence is hard to test because it requires waiting for a long time and I therefore cannot freely test for several times.","files":null}]}
