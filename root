I've never made an android app before but I changed some variables around after installing android studio which resulted with [this](https://gist.github.com/alvierahman90/e679934770d03f81e3db63e1c9987a12) which looks like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TeDCUVv.png)\n\nPreferably the app will be able to switch between dark and light modes as android changes between dark and light mode. \n\nI will try to figure out how to do it myself and submit a pull request but, as I said, I've never done android development before so no guarantees.","files":null}]}
