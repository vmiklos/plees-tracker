I thought maybe they are UNIX dates, so i tried converting them but it turns out, they give me some really wild results. take for example\n\n```\nsid,start,stop\n3,1588031041720,1588070163374\n5,1588142846876,1588165544783\n\n```\n\nif we are to convert them i get something like\n\n09/12/52292 @ 9:48pm (UTC)\n\nWhich is way beyond the mark. What should i do?","files":null}]}
