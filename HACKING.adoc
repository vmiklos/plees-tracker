= Coding style

- Prefer initializing properties inline over spelling them out in a separate `init {` block.

- Use annotations (`@Foo`) only when it makes the code easier to read.

- Prefer references (`Foo`) over nullable references (`Foo?`).

- Prefer variable names which are not keywords over working the problem around with backticks
  ('`is`').

- Prefer constructs like `foo?.let {` over non-null assertions (`!!`).

== Complex parts of the app

The app code is quite simple, this is just fancy stopwatch after all. But some parts are nontrivial:

- Making sure that the timer doesn't stop, by launching a proper background service was hard to
  figure out.

- The icon was surprisingly challenging to add, mostly because every SVG editor will just scale your
  image, but exactly scaling is ignored by Android Studio's SVG import.

- The recycler view was tricky to set up: most examples are overcomplicated, when really what was
  needed here is just an adapter and a holder class.

== Checks which are not part of CI

Missing license headers:

----
for i in $(git ls-files| grep '\.kt[s"]\?$'); do grep -q LICENSE $i && continue; echo $i; done
----

Check for formatting problems in case ktlint hook was not installed during commit:

----
git ls-files| grep '\.kt[s"]\?$' | xargs ktlint --android --relative .
----

== Kotlin

If you are used to Java, then not spelling out type names all over the place is confusing in Kotlin.

on how to let Android Studio show these types for you without polluting the code.
